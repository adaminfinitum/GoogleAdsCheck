# GoogleAdsCheck
~~Marijuana google ads are illegal, this script googles keywords and checks if there are any ads present. If ads are present a google feedback form will be pre-populated, ready to report ad.~~

While the original author, @hugoiriarte, wrote this script to check Google SERPs for ads for a prohibited drug, it is unlikely to be effective because the keywords it queries are essentially blacklisted and couldn't be added to an account or run without 'requesting an exception' by a human reviewer.

The "MMJ Card" and "MMJ Doctor" keywords might slip under the radar but any success circumventing Google's policies is, in my experience, likely to be short lived. 

I'm pretty sure adding any of the keywords listed to an account would be (at best) ineffective and (at worst) would get your account banned...and even if the keywords somehow got approved, you'd then have to get ads approved.

For anyone inclined to try to get away with it, I suppose you might be able to get around keyword approval issues by using dynamic search ads which don't use keywords to target ads, they use the content of your website but I still doubt you'd get away with it for very long...and if you did you'd be inviting a federal indictment for conspiracy to distribute a schedule I controlled substance.

Beyond that, Google prohibits scaping of it search results so you'd be breaking one Google policy to report violations of another policy.

## Why I forked this
This script could be handy, if used judiciously (probably with a distributed crawler and modified so it doesn't make any attempt to report/submit a form) to conduct ad research on different keywords...so I forked it just in case I have a use for it later.
